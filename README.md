# TOS Report Card

**Instant A-F grades for Terms of Service and Privacy Policies.**

Stop blindly accepting terms you haven't read. TOS Report Card uses AI to analyze any Terms of Service or Privacy Policy in seconds, giving you a clear letter grade, plain-language summary, red flags, and highlights so you can make informed decisions before clicking "I Accept."

## Why This Exists

Nobody reads Terms of Service until it's too late. Legal documents filled with jargon protect companies, not users. Rights get waived, data gets sold, and people have no recourse because they "agreed" to something they never understood.

**TOS Report Card brings transparency to the fine print.** Built by someone who advises governments on responsible AI and procurement, this tool applies the same principles of clarity and accountability to the agreements we encounter every day online.

- **🆓 100% Free ** — No account required, no paywall, no tracking

## How It Works

1. **User clicks the extension** on a page with Terms of Service
2. **Extension extracts the text** from the webpage
3. **Text is sent to Claude AI** (Anthropic) for analysis via a secure API
4. **AI returns a grade, summary, red flags, and highlights**
5. **Results display instantly** in the extension popup

### Architecture

```
┌──────────────┐      ┌──────────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐
│   Browser    │ ───> │ Cloudflare Worker│ ───> │ Anthropic AI │
│  Extension   │ <─── │   (API Proxy)    │ <─── │   (Claude)   │
└──────────────┘      └──────────────────┘      └──────────────┘
```

The extension never stores your Anthropic API key. All AI requests are proxied through a secure Cloudflare Worker that handles authentication server-side.

## Privacy & Security

**Your privacy matters.** Here's exactly what data is collected and how it's used:

- **TOS text is sent to Claude AI** for analysis (required for grading)
- **No browsing history is tracked** — the extension only reads pages when you click it
- **No personal data is collected** — we don't store names, emails, or any identifiable information
- **No analytics or tracking scripts** — zero telemetry
- **API key is never exposed** — stored securely server-side in the Cloudflare Worker

The extension requests only the minimum permissions needed:
- `activeTab` — Read the current page when you click the icon
- `scripting` — Extract text from the page for analysis
- `host_permissions` (api.anthropic.com) — Send text to AI for grading
